## About Me

Where do I start...

### Why 'youngd24'?

I was signing up for Compuserve and my usual username, youngd, was taken. I was 24 at the time,
not a whole lot of thought went into it. I use 241 at times as a homage to the octal mode my brain
seems to work in:

```
d-w-r----x
```

I write to it, seemingly can never remember (read) from it while my team can, everyone else, well,
you can run code from it if you can find it. setuid/setgid is not set on it nor do I know what
the umask really is.

### Why DY?

They're my initials, duh. But in reality I worked with someone years back, and for quite some time,
that called me that, it took and everyone else adopted it, no idea why.

```
"Yo, DY, where's that Disksuite installer at?"
```
