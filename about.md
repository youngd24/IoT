## About Me

Where do I start...

### Why 'youngd24'?

I was signing up for Compuserve and my usual username, youngd, was taken. I was 24 at the time.
Not a whole lot of thought went into it. I use 241 at times as a homage to the octal mode my brain
seems to work in:

```
--w-r----x
```

I write to it, seemingly can never remember (read) from it while others can, everyone else, well,
you can run code from it if you can find it.
