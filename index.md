## DY's Ramblings on IoT

For the last number of years I watched others dabble in the "Internet of Things" (IoT) area,
and while I thought it was interesting I didn't really have the time to commit to
learning it. Well, that changed in 2020 due to, well, you know, 2020. Now it's the start of
2022, I've actually learned a thing or two and want to document that.

This site, much like the content in it, is also an experiment. I wanted to learn how to use
GitHub pages to host content as well as the underlying static content generator they use,
Jekyll. So beware, it might not look good from time to time and things might be broken.
